# Thread::Local

Provides a simple high level interface for per-class thread locals. Implements a standard interface for "shared global state". Avoid reinventing thread-local semantics in your own code by using this implementation.

[![Development Status](https://github.com/socketry/thread-local/workflows/Development/badge.svg)](https://github.com/socketry/thread-local/actions?workflow=Development)

## Features

- Convert global state to thread local state easily.
- Avoid race conditions and data corruption.
- Provides a standard interface for policy driven design.

## Motivation

In my own web framework, [utopia](https://github.com/socketry/utopia), I have been struggling with the best way to expose configuration details. I was setting both global variables and modifying `ENV` which made it impossible to have multiple isolated instances of the application in the same process. This in turn makes it hard to implement things like graceful restart in multi-threaded [falcon](https://github.com/socketry/falcon). Such issues also affect application code running in other multi-threaded contexts, which are becoming increasingly common (e.g. JRuby, TruffleRuby).

Global variables are often not thread-safe and encourage poor programming style. In many cases it is desirable to have thread-local state, but implementing this directly in Ruby is unpleasant. This gem provides a best-practice wrapper which can extend existing classes to provide per-thread instances.

Conceptually, a thread is a container for application state. This works well when servers consider applications to be isolated on a per-thread basis, but this isn't always the case:

| Server               | Application      | Thread Safety            |
|----------------------|------------------|--------------------------|
| Falcon Multi-Process | One per process. | Isolated.                |
| Falcon Multi-Thread  | One per thread.  | Isolated, Shared State.  |
| Puma Multi-Thread    | One per process. | Reentrant, Shared State. |
| Puma Cluster         | One per worker.  | Reentrant, Shared State. |
| Unicorn              | One per process. | Isolated.                |

Puma requires applications to be completely thread safe and reentrant, which isn't always easy. However, this gem attempts to provide a model which works in all the above servers, providing isolated, thread-safe, mutable per-thread state.
