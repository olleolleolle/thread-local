	<h1>Thread::Local</h1><p>Provides a simple high level interface for per-class thread locals. Implements a standard interface for &quot;shared global state&quot;. Avoid reinventing thread-local semantics in your own code by using this implementation.</p>

<ul>
<li>Convert global state to thread local state easily.</li>
<li>Avoid race conditions and data corruption.</li>
<li>Provides a standard interface for policy driven design.</li>

</section><section id="motivation"><h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>In my own web framework, <a href="https://github.com/socketry/utopia">utopia</a>, I have been struggling with the best way to expose configuration details. I was setting both global variables and modifying <code>ENV</code> which made it impossible to have multiple isolated instances of the application in the same process. This in turn makes it hard to implement things like graceful restart in multi-threaded <a href="https://github.com/socketry/falcon">falcon</a>. Such issues also affect application code running in other multi-threaded contexts, which are becoming increasingly common (e.g. JRuby, TruffleRuby).</p>
<p>Global variables are often not thread-safe and encourage poor programming style. In many cases it is desirable to have thread-local state, but implementing this directly in Ruby is unpleasant. This gem provides a best-practice wrapper which can extend existing classes to provide per-thread instances.</p>
<p>Conceptually, a thread is a container for application state. This works well when servers consider applications to be isolated on a per-thread basis, but this isn't always the case:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Server</th>
<th>Application</th>
<th>Thread Safety</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Falcon Multi-Process</td>
<td>One per process.</td>
<td>Isolated.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Falcon Multi-Thread</td>
<td>One per thread.</td>
<td>Isolated, Shared State.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Puma Multi-Thread</td>
<td>One per process.</td>
<td>Reentrant, Shared State.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Puma Cluster</td>
<td>One per worker.</td>
<td>Reentrant, Shared State.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Unicorn</td>
<td>One per process.</td>
<td>Isolated.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Puma requires applications to be completely thread safe and reentrant, which isn't always easy. However, this gem attempts to provide a model which works in all the above servers, providing isolated, thread-safe, mutable per-thread state.</p>
